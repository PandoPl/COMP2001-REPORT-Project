Trails can be viewed, created, updated, deleted. Creation, updating and deletion are done by Admins. Normal users can view the trails but not all the information. Admins can view, create, update and delete user accounts. There is a login process that gives you an authentication token that you have to enter at the top right on the swagger UI where it says "Authenticate". Enter the token in the format "Bearer [token]"
